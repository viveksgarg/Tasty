## Introduction to Tasty

This project was developed as part of a certification program introduced by our organization's management. The program required developers to become certified Android developers through two stages. 
This is not my best work, to be fairly judged I have added a list of enhancements, that I plan to implement.

- The first stage involved a Kotlin proficiency test, which I cleared on my first attempt with a score of 86 out of 100.
- In the second stage, I delivered an application based on provided UI/UX wireframes, achieving a score of around 84. While the application meets the initial requirements, there are areas for improvement which I plan to address in future iterations.

Enhancements planned for future iterations:
- Refine and improve the project architecture, possibly transitioning to Clean Architecture principles for clearer organization and scalability. Additionally, I aim to follow SOLID principles for better code maintainability and extensibility.
- Implement HILT dependency injection for better modularization and maintainability.
- Incorporate unit tests as well as UI tests into the application for ensuring code quality and application robustness.
- Migrate from SharedPreferences to KeyStore implementation for improved security of sensitive data.
- Incorporate StateFlow instead of LiveData for better handling of data streams in the UI.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing processes.
  - Add LINT checks for code quality and style adherence.
  - Automate UI tests and unit tests execution as part of the CI pipeline.
